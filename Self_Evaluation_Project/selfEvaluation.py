# Her we would like to have a system maybe based on multiple agents that analyse the conversation and store cases where the conversation failed. It would also be possible to let the models talk to themself and find out their own weaknesses and store them. One could imagine that one LLM googles facts onloine that are easy to ask and check but hard to generate. This way the judge model can test another model and figutre out its weaknesses and store them.
