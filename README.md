# LLMsBooster
GPT-4 and Gemini are the best Large Language Models out there.
However lots of research goes into improving them with new papers showing how to do that.

Whats missing is a list of all these papers and corresponding implementations with simple toggles to activate them and see if they truely improve the results in your use case.

The Idea would be to build your application not directly around the GPT-4 or Gemini API but around this LLMsBooster which acesses the same APIs in an optimized way and also improves the outputs which you then use for your application.
