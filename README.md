# LLMsBooster
GPT-4 and Gemini are the best Large Language Models out there today with similar performance in benschmarks.

However lots of research goes into how to improve them furthere.

What's missing is a list of all these papers and corresponding implementations with simple toggles to activate them and see if they truely improve the results in your use case.

The Idea would be to build your application not directly around the GPT-4 or Gemini API but around this LLMsBooster which acesses the same APIs in an optimized way and also improves the outputs which you then use for your application.

Fine-Tuning would be nice for some use cases as well, but is not possible with these close source LLMs and is not a topic in this project.

# List of Strategies to Improve the Performance

## Input

### Prompt Engeneering

## Output

### Agents

## Other

#### Use Multiple LLMs

You can simply use Gemini and GPT-4 in paralle. The script sends the prompt to booth models and displays the outputs next to each other.
